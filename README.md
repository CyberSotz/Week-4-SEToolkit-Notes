# The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SEToolkit) – Professional Handbook

---

## 1. **Introduction to SEToolkit**

The **Social-Engineer Toolkit (SEToolkit)** is an open-source penetration testing framework created by **David Kennedy (TrustedSec)**. It focuses specifically on **social engineering attacks**, which target human vulnerabilities rather than purely technical flaws.  

- **Purpose**: To simulate real-world phishing, website cloning, and credential harvesting attacks for training and awareness.  
- **Scope**: Used by **penetration testers, red teams, and security researchers** to assess how organizations respond to targeted social engineering attempts.  
- **Ethical Considerations**: SET must only be used in authorized environments. Unauthorized use may result in **legal consequences**. Always have **written approval** before conducting assessments.  
- **Installation Requirements**:  
  - Pre-installed in **Kali Linux**  
  - Python 3.x  
  - Integration with **Metasploit Framework**  

---

## 2. **Core Architecture**

- **SET Configuration Files**:  
  Located in `/etc/setoolkit/` where global configs (SMTP servers, ports, etc.) can be tuned.  
- **Payload Generation Modules**:  
  Creates **reverse shells, Meterpreter payloads, and obfuscated files**.  
- **Integration with Metasploit**:  
  Automatically launches Metasploit handlers to catch payload connections.  
- **Logging and Output Structure**:  
  Logs are saved in `/root/.set/`. Each attack session creates a dedicated log folder.

## 3. **Attack Vectors Overview**

SEToolkit provides multiple attack avenues, categorized as follows:

1. **Spear Phishing Attacks** – Targeted phishing emails with malicious payloads.  
2. **Website Attack Vectors** – Clone websites or inject malicious code.  
3. **Infectious Media Generator** – Create malware-laced USB/DVDs.  
4. **Arduino-Based Attacks** – Payloads delivered via microcontrollers.  
5. **QRCode Generator Attack** – Encodes malicious URLs into QR codes.  
6. **Powershell Attack Vectors** – Exploiting Windows systems with obfuscated PowerShell scripts.  

---

## 4. **Website Attack Vectors**

- **Credential Harvester Attack**:  
  Clones a login page, captures credentials submitted by the victim.  

- **Tabnabbing**:  
  Exploits inactive browser tabs by replacing them with a phishing page.  

- **Web Jacking**:  
  Creates a fake link overlay, redirecting victims to a phishing site.  

- **MITM Setup**:  
  Combines SET with tools like Ettercap for transparent interception.  

- **Cloning Legitimate Websites**:  
  Full-page clone of target websites with malicious injection.  

---

## 5. **Email & Phishing Attacks**

- **Email Template Creation**: Use default or custom-crafted HTML templates.  
- **Spoofing Techniques**: Forge sender address (e.g., pretending to be HR).  
- **Sending Payloads via Email**: Attach malicious executables or links.  
- **Bypassing Spam Filters**: Use obfuscation and encoding to avoid detection.  

---

## 6. **Payloads & Listeners**

- **Types of Payloads**:  
  - Reverse TCP shells  
  - Meterpreter sessions  
  - Powershell payloads  

- **Custom Payload Creation**: Specify ports, IP addresses, and obfuscation.  
- **Listener Configuration**: Auto-configured via Metasploit or Netcat.  
- **Obfuscation Techniques**: Encodes payloads to bypass antivirus software.  

---

## 7. **Third-Party Integrations**

- **Metasploit Framework** – Catch shells, run post-exploitation modules.  
- **Empire Integration** – Leverages advanced PowerShell exploitation.  
- **Post-Exploitation Tools** – Pivot deeper into the victim network.  
- **VPNs and Proxychains** – Maintain anonymity and evade detection.  

---

## 8. **Automation & Scripting**

- Automating SET attacks with **Bash scripting**.  
- Run **automated phishing campaigns** with multiple targets.  
- **Report generation** for client deliverables.  

---

## 9. **Real-World Scenarios**

- **Corporate Phishing Simulation**: Test employee awareness.  
- **Red Team vs Blue Team**: Measure SOC detection response.  
- **Case Studies**: Notable SET-based campaigns in training labs.  

---

## 10. **Defensive Countermeasures**

- **Blue Team Detection**: Monitor suspicious traffic, DNS requests.  
- **Email Gateways**: Block spoofed domains.  
- **Web Filtering/DNS Monitoring**: Identify cloned or phishing sites.  
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**: Flag malicious payloads.  

---

## 11. **Legal & Ethical Boundaries**

- **Responsible Disclosure**: Inform organizations of vulnerabilities.  
- **Pentest Agreements**: Always operate with written client approval.  
- **Laws on Social Engineering**: Using SET without consent is illegal.  

---

## 12. **Troubleshooting & FAQs**

- **SET Not Launching**: Ensure Python & dependencies are installed.  
- **Payloads Not Connecting**: Check firewall & listener settings.  
- **Listener Not Receiving**: Verify ports and Metasploit handlers.
